# Django Action Trigger (In Development)

Django Action Trigger is a Django application that allows the user to trigger actions based on changes in the database.
These actions may be hitting a webhook, adding a message to a queue.

These triggers can be triggered either in the code, or by the UI in the Django admin interface.
